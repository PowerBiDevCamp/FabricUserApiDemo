# Fabric User API Demo

The Fabric User API provides developers with the ability to automate
tasks in the Fabric environment such as creating and managing Fabric
workspaces and workspace items. This GitHub repository contains a
developer sample named **FabricUserApiDemo** which is a C# console
application demonstrating how to create Fabric workspaces and Fabric
workspace items included semantic models, reports, lakehouses and
notebooks.

renamed to **semantic models**.
